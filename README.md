# Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenge: RevLocAcc_CTF.apk

This repository provides a detailed walkthrough of the CTF challenge created by me involving the `RevLocAcc_CTF.apk` file. There are two methods to solve this challenge.

## Method 1: Using apktool

### Step 1: Decompiling the APK
Decompile the APK file using apktool with the following command:

```apktool d ./RevLocAcc_CTF.apk```

### Step 2: Analyzing the Assets Folder
Navigate to the `assets` folder which contains two files: `sensitive.db` and `AndroidManifest.xml`. The `AndroidManifest.xml` file contains coordinates. Perform Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) on these coordinates to get the location name.

### Step 3: Unlocking the Database
The location name "TajMahal" is the password to unlock the `sensitive.db` file.

### Step 4: Finding the Flag
After unlocking the database with the password "TajMahal", you'll find the flag. Congratulations!

## Method 2: Using a Rooted Device or Emulator

### Step 1: Installing the App
Install the app on a rooted device or an emulator.

### Step 2: Running adb shell
Run the following command in adb shell:

```run-as com.example.app```

### Step 3: Copying the Database
Copy the `sensitive.db` file created during the installation into your local system using the following command:

```adb pull /data/user/0/com.example.app/databases/sensitive.db D:\ctf```

### Step 4: Analyzing the Assets Folder
Just like in Method 1, the `assets` folder contains the `AndroidManifest.xml` file with coordinates. Perform OSINT on these coordinates to get the location name.

### Step 5: Unlocking the Database
Again, the location name "TajMahal" is the password to unlock the `sensitive.db` file.

### Step 6: Finding the Flag
After unlocking the database, you'll find the flag. Well done!
